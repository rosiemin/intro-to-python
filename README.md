## Overview
The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to the world of development with Python.

#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* Overview of basic Python and programming concepts
* Building a simple application using Python
* Playing around and break things


#### What is programming?
Programming is giving your computer a set of instructions to perform a task. 

This sounds simple but it can get complicated! 


## Setting up your computer


#### Please set up the following:

* A web browser to see what we're working on as others see it (Recommend Google Chrome: [chrome.google.com] (http://chrome.google.com))

* We will be using an online notebook for this workshop. You can access it here: [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iDMr9Y9JVhb9bQpO_KluiKBWLwuPYHe5)


Well... that was easy! Let's head to the notebook now!


## Try this code out!!
You just learned a lot, so try to put it together and build something!


Try to build a number guessing game using:

- variables
- Comparison Operators
- Conditionals
- loops
- functions
- dialog boxes

If you get stuck or want to look ahead at the completed project you can view it [here](https://repl.it/@gDSIprep/pythonGuessingGame).

What are some ideas for improvements? 

- Exit on command
- data validation
- input the number range from popup
- output grammar depending on number of tries
